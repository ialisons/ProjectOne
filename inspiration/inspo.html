       <h1>Alison's Inspos</h1>
        <h3>These are some of my inspirations!</h3>

         <h2>Clairo</h2>
         <div id="main">
         <img src="img/immunity.png.jpg.webp" alt="The back image of Clairo's Immunity CD, a light salmon colored sink with a hairtie, a colorful beaded bracelet spelling out Clairo, multiple necklaces, two safety pins, and an upright lipstick beside the faucet">
             <p>One of my favorite artists is the singer <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3l0CmX0FuQjFxr8SK7Vqag"> Clairo</a>. I admire her musical talent,specifically her songwriting ability because I emotionally connect with it.
              Her visual design choices/aesthetics of her music inspire me too. The fonts and merch designs are creative and have a special charm which is something that I'd like to apply to my design career.</p>

              <h2>Devon Aoki</h2>
              <div id="main">
                  <img src="img/devon.jpeg.webp" alt="Devon Aoki posing and wearing a light pink tank top, dark blueish-green low-rise jeans, and a black purse on her shoulder">
                     <p> One of my fashion inspirations is <a href="https://www.lofficielusa.com/fashion/supermodel-devon-aokis-best-moments-throughout-the-years"> Devon Aoki</a>, an actress/model. 
                         I like the clothes and the style she had during the 90s-2000s. I admire Devon Aoki's style and the way she carries herself.</p>

                         <h2>dayrisfelix</h2>
                         <div id="main">
                <img src="img/painting.jpeg" alt="acrylic painting of a white puppy with a lipstick kiss mark on its forehead against a pink background">    
             <p>One of my artistic inspirations is an artist on Instagram called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dayrisfelix/?hl=en"> @dayrisfelix</a>.
               I've always liked drawing and painting, but I've always had trouble having a creative style. Their art is distinctive and cute,
               with a nice color palette which is something I like seeing in people's art. As I get into drawing/painting more, I want to be able to do the same.</p>
