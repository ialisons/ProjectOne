        <p>Hi, my name is Alison and I'm majoring in visual communication design.
             I've always enjoyed the more artistic subjects in school, so I kinda consider myself a creative person. 
             I'd also say I'm a very passionate person when it comes to my interests. One of my current interests is Clairo's music, 
             love herrrrr and I saw her in concert for the second time last year! I love going to concerts and I hope to go to more this year. After I graduate, 
             I want to get a job relating to ux/ui design as it's what I plan to work in. In my free time, I like to bake, 
             this is a pretty recent hobby I started with my sister a few months ago where we try to bake every Friday. I also like to draw, play guitar, make edits, spend time with friends/family, listen to music, and watch shows/movies. 
             I would love to have more hobbies and try new things. I enjoy setting goals for myself, one year, I watched a new movie every day! I want to try to do similar things in the future like listening to a new album everyday or finishing a book every month.  </p>
